Vocabulary according to David Black's textbook

Currently the github db files are out of date as the db is being populated via a google docs which will be converted to csv

Morphology conforms mostly to Robinson:
http://wiki.logos.com/Morphology_Codes#Robinson_Greek_Morphology

The main important files are:
VocabularyTable.numbers
VocabularyTable.csv
DBImport.py

DBImport.py is a script to import the CSV file into a database (SQLite3 at the moment)
